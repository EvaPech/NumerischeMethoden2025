1) Give one disadvantage of forward Euler for stiff ODEs.

As forward Euler is quite simple it is not stable for stiff function, as they may need small time steps (bc. stiff ODEs can change rapidly). 
FE is inefficient with smaller steps (as it is good for rough estimates)
 

2) If you fit M parameters to N data points, what are the degrees of freedom f for the Chi-squared distribution?

v (degreed of freedom) is an integer, given by N-M (for linear parameters); for two parameters it is N-2

3) Please describe in a sentence or two what is a Marcov process.

Markic process describes a random process with a markov property (where each random sample is generated based only on the previous one)

4) Describe in a sentence or two why using the threading module and threads in general in python often doesn't accelerate the code.

threads use the same CPU and run in a shared memory space, GIL (Global Interpreter Lock) can be block it (only one thread at a time)  

5) What does the Nyquist theorem say about sampling a signal with maximum frequency f_max and why is this important?

the nyquist frequency fc = 1/2 Delta (where 1/Delta is the sampling rate) and describes the max frquency where the sampling is completely determined; 
if you are outside of the frequency range aliasing (=false translating) can occurrs, it corresponfs to 1/2 of the sampling rate  

6) Briefly describe what is PCA.

Principal component analysis; simpple, non parametric method to describe a complex data set. 
It presents a roadmap on how to reduce the complexity of a data set by lowering the dimesnions. 

7) What is one disadvantage of acceptance–rejection sampling compared to inverse transform sampling?
if you want exact numbers of random deviates it can be less usefull
